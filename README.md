# Football Game Video Analysis
Welcome to the Football Game Video Analysis repository! This project leverages both classic and deep learning computer vision techniques to analyze football game videos. The goal is to detect, track, and analyze the movements of players and the ball, recognize actions, and provide statistical information on the game.

## Features
- **Player Detection and Tracking**: Using YOLO to detect and track players.
- **Ball Detection**: Custom color-based detection and YOLO for ball tracking.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculation of ball control, possession, and other game statistics.
- **Team assigner**: assign each player to a team.
- **Visualization**: Overlay of detected objects, tracks, and events on video frames.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- sklearn
